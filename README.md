OADA API Specification
======================
The OADA API is intended to serve as a specification for all providers that desire to be OADA compliant. This API does not attempt to define or enforce a single industry data standard. The goal of this API is to enable interoperability between the many precision ag software systems and existing industry data types. By providing an extensible API that focuses on information exchange and facilitates data transformations an open heterogeneous environment that supports many legacy, current, and future data formats can be embraced.

Authentication
--------------
The open authorization standard OAuth 2 will be leveraged as the protocol to secure OADA APIs.

TODO
--------------
* Review terms and naming conventions in API and JSON schemas
* Validate syntax of API and JSON schemas
* Define list of precision ag data types: examples/data-types.json
* Define list of precision ag file formats: examples/supported-file-formats.json
* Verification suite
* Reference implementation
