OADA API Specification
======================
The OADA API is intended to serve as a specification for all providers that desire to be OADA compliant. This API does not attempt to define or enforce a single industry data standard. The goal of this API is to enable interoperability between the many precision ag software systems and existing industry data types. By providing an extensible API that focuses on information exchange and facilitates data transformations an open heterogeneous environment that supports many legacy, current, and future data formats can be embraced.

## About
For complete details on the OADA REST API, please see this [oada-wiki entry][oada-wiki-rest-api]. If you are intrested in more information about the whole OADA project, please peruse the project wiki [here][oada-wiki]

## License
OADA is openly developed and built under the MIT License. 

## Current Version
The current version of the OADA API specification is intended to be a draft revision to seek input and feedback from the larger precision ag community.

The draft specification has been defined in the RESTful API Modeling Language ([RAML](http://raml.org/)). The draft API specification in its entirety can be found here: [oada-api.raml](https://github.com/OADA/oada-api-spec/blob/oada-api.raml)

To improve the readability of the specification it rendered into HTML by raml2html (developed by [kevinrenskers/raml2html][raml2html]) from time to time:

- [Active Development draft - v0.2](http://openag.io/docs/v0_2.html)
